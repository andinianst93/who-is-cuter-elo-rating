# Elo rating system overview

The Elo rating system is used to calculate the relative skill levels of players (or in this case, dogs) in two-player games. The key components of the Elo rating system are:

1. Current Ratings (R1, R2): The current ratings of the two dogs.
2. Expected Scores (E1, E2): The expected score for each dog, calculated based on their current ratings.
3. Actual Scores (S1, S2): The actual score, which is 1 for the winner and 0 for the loser.
4. New Ratings (R1', R2'): The updated ratings after the match.
